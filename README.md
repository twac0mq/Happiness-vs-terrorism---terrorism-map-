The Costs of Terrorism & Factors that Contribute to Happiness

Our project team, consisting of Zane Brown, Alejandro Montesinos, Aaron Chen and Christian de Vera, studied the costs of terrorism: in terms of the mortality rate worldwide and its economic costs in various European countries. In addition we examined the factors that contribute to a country’s overall level of happiness. To what extent do socioeconomic level and behavioral risk factors contribute to well-being? What countries have the happiest citizens? 

So Many Lives Ended Prematurely

Zane used the global terrorism database to examine global death rates from 1970-2017 caused by 280,000 terrorist acts. He sought to answer the following questions:

Do certain countries consistently suffer from terrorism , or has there been a “spike” in terrorist acts in certain decades?
How about the US? Was 9/11 an isolated incident?
Has the number of people who perished from terrorism increased over time?

Chloropleths from the five decades illustrate that longitudinally, there has been a massive increase in mortality from terrorist acts. In the 70s, the United Kingdom led the world with 1769 lives lost. Contrast that to the period 2010-2017 where 4 countries have each experienced more than 10,000 deaths.

On the other hand, aside from 9/11, in the United States there has never been a decade with more than 300 lives lost. Have the police and FBI done a remarkable job at vigilance (or deterrence), or was the government reaction overblown?

Terrorism tends to spike in various countries over a decade or two due to internecine conflict. Witness Nicaragua, El Salvador, Colombia and Sri Lanka in the 80s, Sri Lanka, Algeria and Colombia in the 90s, Iraq  and the US in the 2000s and Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria in the 2010s. Only India and Pakistan have been at each other’s throats since the 1980s.







The Impact of Terrorism on Economic Growth

Alejandro continued our survey with a look at the economic consequences of terrorist acts throughout Europe by developing an interactive choropleth map. We focus on the European Union due to data availability and studies analyzing the recent high profile attacks in Europe such as the 2015 Paris attacks and the 2016 attacks in Brussels.

Several studies have found that terrorism has a tangible but relatively small and short-term negative effect on the economy. It is estimated that during the period from 2004 to 2016 the cost of terrorism in the European Union was about € 180 billion in lost GDP
 
In our interactive map we present the economic cost of terrorism by country and the number of attacks and fatalities from terrorist attacks from 2004-2016. Each country is colored in a tone of green with darkest color representing higher cost. The map allows hovering over the countries and highlighting the country borders in yellow when the mouse is over that country. In addition to that, country-specific data on economic cost (total and per capita) and terrorism (number of attacks, deaths and injuries) is displayed in the top left corner of the map when a country is highlighted.

The map show that a higher cost of terrorism is positively associated with the severity of the attacks measured in the number of deaths and injuries. During the 2004-2016 period the EU countries that experienced the highest cost of terrorism were the United Kingdom, France and Spain.
 
Factors that Contribute to a Country’s Overall Happiness 

Then Aaron shifted gears to analyze the factors that contribute to happiness in selected countries. From the World Happiness Report he looked at the following countries: Norway, Australia, US (some of the happiest countries in the major continents) and Afghanistan (a country with miserable folks).
  
He created multiple pie charts using Javascript, html, and css, pulling in data from several CSV files, to demonstrate the different factors that contribute to a country’s happiness. The higher a country’s GDP and level of social support, the happier its people. 

In contrast for citizens of Afghanistan, their displeasure stemmed from low GDP and high corruption. Surprisingly the relative freedom of a country has no effect on happiness. He highlighted this finding with visualizations from the “anime” Javascript library where the title was animated.
Societal Trends and Their Correlations with Happiness

Through HTML, CSS, D3, and JavaScript, Christian created an interactive scatter plot displaying the correlations between happiness and various demographic and behavioral factors. Data used in the graph was extracted from multiple online sources including the World Happiness Report and ourworldindata.com. He concatenated the relevant data into a Pandas dataframe before loading it into one CSV file.

The following factors were compared to happiness scores.

Life Expectancy - In general, the greater the life expectancy, the happier the country’s citizens. Out of all the factors considered, life expectancy had the strongest correlation with the happiness index.
GDP per capita - This factor had the second highest correlation with happiness. This is as expected as a larger disposable income allows one to have money left over for non-essentials like hobbies and travel.
Alcoholism - Surprisingly there was not a negative correlation between alcoholism rate and happiness. In fact, it was slightly positive, though to such an insignificant degree that you can say there is no meaningful relationship between the two trends.
Suicide Rate – Another unexpected result as there was no negative correlation with happiness.
Terrorist Act Rate – Again another trend with no significant correlation with happiness, although the three countries with the highest terrorist rates (Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya) have endured recent US intervention.
Drug Abuse Rate – A rather surprising trend as it actually has a strong positive correlation with happiness with the USA being at the very top of the world in this category.
Anxiety Rate – Another negative trend in society somehow has a positive correlation with happiness score. When it comes to drug abuse and anxiety, I hypothesize that many of those suffering from them probably weren't surveyed for the happiness report. 

Even in lands of opportunity, there can be many people who feel alienated due to financial inequalities, differing cultural values, and our overemphasis on the individual over the collective. But the topic of loneliness, culture, and financial insecurity are subjects for another time.
